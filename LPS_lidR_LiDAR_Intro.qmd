## Overview

-   **Li**ght **D**etection **a**nd **R**anging (lidar)
-   The lidR package - a brief introduction
-   Workshop overview

## What is lidar?

-   **Li**ght **D**etection **a**nd **R**anging
-   Active form of remote sensing
-   Measures distance to target surfaces with millions of narrow light pulses
-   Airborne laser scanning performs lidar systematically from aircraft or drones

## Lidar Data – Point Clouds

::: columns

::: column

- Discrete returns are aggregated into point clouds (`.LAS/.LAZ`)  
- Lidar points have three-dimensional (`XYZ`) coordinates, and other attributes (`Intensity`, `ReturnNumber`, etc...)  
- Point clouds can be processed into vegetation structure summaries with **lidR**

::: notes
As with many remote sensing data analyses tasks we are seeking to produce `information` from `simplification` to pull a signal of interest (in this case variability in vegetation structure) out of our dataset (a dense point cloud of three-dimensional coordinates that characterize the vegetation)

To do so we often generate summary metrics that act similarly to spectral indices in passive optical remote sensing, they ratio or generate statistics on the distribution of points (max, mean height, canopy cover, percentiles, leaf-area density profiles)

## lidR

::: columns

::: column
- Written by `Jean-Romain Roussel`  
- Package for `manipulating` and `visualizing` ALS data  
- Written entirely open source within R-geospatial ecosystem (`terra`/`sf`)  
- Most processes run efficiently with back-end `C++` code

```{r lidR-downloads, echo=FALSE}
source('R/lidR_downloads_plot.R')
```

## LAStools

::: columns

::: column
- Industry grade software suite produced by rapidlasso  
- 52 command-line tools for mutlicore batch processing lidar data
- More memory efficient than lidR (doesn't load as dataframe)
- Some tools required paid license

## r-lidar

::: columns

::: column
- lidR author `Jean-Romain Roussel` is commited to maintaining the `lidR` package as fully open source
- He now runs `r-lidar`; a consulting and development company targeted at lidar applications
- Visit `r-lidar.com` for more information
